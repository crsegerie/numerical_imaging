# SinGAN analysis with PathMatch algotithm.

This repository contains a study of the creative capabilities of the SinGAN network.
We propose a rigorous method to evaluate the image creation capabilities of a GAN using the PatchMatch algorithm.

The method is described in our report. In short, we define the originality of an image with respect to a reference image by computing different metrics from the vector field generated by PatthMatch.

We can see on the image opposite that the originality of an image created by SinGAN is much higher than that of an image using simple copy-paste. The entropy of the histograms and the correlation of the different directions of the vector field allow to formalize this intuition.

The video presents our results in detail.

An implementation of the PatchMatch algorithm can be found in the PatchMatch.ipynb file, which allows to reconstitute the patterns contained in the report.
